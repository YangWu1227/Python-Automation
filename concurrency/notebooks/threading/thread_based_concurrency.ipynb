    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `concurrent.futures` module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing callables. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class extends the `Executor` class and returns a `Future` object. Note, the `Executor` is an abstract class that provides methods to execute calls asynchronously. It should not be used directly, but through its concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `Executor` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Executor` class has three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `submit(fn, /, *args, **kwargs)` – dispatch a function to be executed as `fn(*args, **kwargs)` and return a `Future` object. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- `map(func, *iterables, timeout=None, chunksize=1)` – execute a function asynchronously for each element in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Similar to `map(func, *iterables)` except:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the iterables are collected immediately rather than lazily.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `func` is executed asynchronously and several calls to func may be made concurrently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `shutdown(wait=True, *, cancel_futures=False)` – shut down the executor. Calls to `Executor.submit()` and `Executor.map()` made after shutdown will raise `RuntimeError`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "When we create a new instance of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class, Python starts the `Executor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `Future` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Future` class encapsulates the asynchronous execution of a callable. `Future` instances are created by `Executor.submit()` and should not be created directly except for testing. The `Future` class has two important methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `result(timeout=None)` – return the result of an asynchronous operation. If the call hasn’t yet completed then this method will wait up to `timeout` seconds. If the call hasn’t completed in timeout seconds, then a `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` will be raised. If `timeout` is not specified or `None`, there is no limit to the wait time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `exception(timeout=None)` – return the exception of an asynchronous operation in case an exception occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `cancel()` - Attempt to cancel the call. If the call is currently being executed or finished running and cannot be cancelled then the method will return False, otherwise the call will be cancelled and the method will return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `done()` - Return `True` if the call was successfully cancelled or finished running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configurations\n",
