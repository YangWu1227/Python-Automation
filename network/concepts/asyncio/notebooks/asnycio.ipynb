    "From the [Fluent Python](https://www.fluentpython.com/extra/classic-coroutines/#intro), there are three kinds of coroutines in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* classic coroutines: A generator function that consumes data sent to it via `coro_func.send(data)` calls, and reads that data by using `yield` in an expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "* generator-based coroutines: A generator function decorated with `@types.coroutine`, which makes it compatible with the new `await` keyword, introduced in Python 3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "* native coroutines: A coroutine defined with `async def`. We can delegate from a native coroutine to another native coroutine or to a generator-based coroutine using the `await` keyword, similar to how classic coroutines use `yield from`."
